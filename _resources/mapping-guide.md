Engaging in diaspora missions in your own community requires knowing who is around you and where you can engage them in gospel ministry. Local churches are often intimidated by the prospect of mapping their community and researching people groups, because it seems like something that requires a professional missionary or anthropologist. Of course, this is not true, and any church can learn to discover their community.

The following is a short, step-by-step guide for using free Google services to develop a map of your community and your congregation. This tool is good for local churches attempting any form of community outreach or for associations and conventions to use in order to build an area-wide strategy for equipping churches. The resource is brief but provides the steps necessary to use these tools for mapping.
